In practical We develop a Semester Registration System for Sherubtse College using the MVC pattern and having Node.js, Express.js, EJS, and PostgreSQL as part of the technology stack. This stage focused on making users could easily log in and register, verify their emails, forgotten passwords, and manage their account, which are important for running the registration platform smoothly.

The first thing we did was set up the required dependencies with npm and then installed express, pg, dotenv, bcryptjs, jsonwebtoken, nodemailer, and several more. Based on the MVC design pattern, we built a directory structure where controllers, models, views, and routes are all kept in their own places. The users table, a PostgreSQL table, was created with SQL commands in a function stored in userModel.js. There are columns for the id, username, email, password, role, is_verified, and email and password tokens in this table. The database connection is set up in a separate file, db.js, with the help of environment variables to keep it safe.
All the key code for authentication is found in the authController.js file. While registering, bcryptjs takes care of securing the user’s password with hashing, and jsonwebtoken is used to create a verification token. After registration, the user gets an email via nodemailer that has a verification link. When they click it, their status updates to is_verified = true. The login process checks the user’s information and verifies the email before letting them access the account. Password recovery allows users to request a reset link sent to their registered email, and after clicking on it, they can update their password in the form linked on the page. It works in a way similar to email verification, which controls both security and expiration.

In EJS are used to show the frontend, and there are views designed for login, signup, forgot password, reset password, and landing pages. They make use of forms that POST data to the necessary routes. A basic CSS stylesheet is included to make sure the UI is the same and tidy in all situations. The requests between users and the server are managed by routing with Express, and all are handled in the authRoutes.js file. The file app.js is configuring the server to use session and cookie tools, handle static files, install view engines, and initialize the PostgreSQL database to ensure the user table shows up.
Finally, the practical gives the web application the secure and flexible backend it needs for adding student, faculty, and admin roles in the future. Email verification and hashed passwords demonstrate that best practices are followed when handling user data and developing the web app. At this point, the framework is ready to launch extra parts, such as semester scheduling, subject signup, and back-end administrative views.
